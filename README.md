# Unity2D_ParallelGame_v1

The parallel Game means the game world and the reality life are two parallel and important lines in your life . They don't need to be seperation. The game is finding a way to connect the reality and the game world.

Sometimes we found that we spend too much time in playing the game because the game is interesting and exciting where the life is frustrating and boring. However, playing game couldn't help us in the reality most fo the time. We usually feel why am I wasting so much time in the game? If I started the work earlier, I really had a chance to make it. 

Why can't we find a way to connect the two worlds. There are people who can keep balance between games and life. For those who can't, we try to do it in a game way.

The main game is a 2D game. If you want to play this game, you need to earn points from the reality. And [loosing 1 life, buying items, ... ] in the game will consume the points you earn from the reality.

To earn points from the reality, you need to do in the another part of the game, which is set the goal of your daily life and achive the goal. Using the components in the game to set a goal you want to achive, work towards the goal in your life and after you achive the goal, you can get the points you set for the goal.

In the version 1.0, you may supervise yourself to decide wheather you achive the goal, how many points you can get in a task.
In the future version, if you choose to add a supervisor to monitor your progress. Then only the supervisor can decide if you are avalible for the points.
